//Mufasa online paymaent handling system. Contains functionality for Mufasa and three stub classes(CountryList,bank, cvcCheck)
//There are basic tests for the inputs and for the stubs in the file MufasaTests
//Does not contain the actual site in which these functions would be used because I'm under the impression it was not part of the assignment
//Therefore it also lacks captcha check

package fi.oulu.tol.sqat;
public class Mufasa{
	public void Actual_site(){
		//Site which creates a person class and calls its setters through a form.
		//Does the same for Banking details and implements a button which calls the transaction function
	}
